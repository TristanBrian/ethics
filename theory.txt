Q1: Define algorithmic bias and provide two examples of how it manifests in AI systems.
Algorithmic bias refers to systematic and unfair discrimination in AI systems due to flawed assumptions, biased training data, or design choices, leading to unequal outcomes for different groups.

Examples:

Hiring Algorithms: AI recruitment tools trained on historical data may favor male candidates for technical roles if past hiring was male-dominated.

Facial Recognition: Some systems have higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals due to underrepresentation in training datasets.


Q2: Explain the difference between transparency and explainability in AI. Why are both important?
Transparency refers to openness about how an AI system is developed, including data sources, model architecture, and decision-making processes.

Explainability is the ability to interpret and justify AI decisions in understandable terms for users or stakeholders.

Importance:

Transparency builds trust and accountability by allowing scrutiny of AI development.

Explainability ensures users understand AI decisions, enabling corrections and compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR’s "right to explanation").

Q3: How does GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) impact AI development in the EU?
GDPR imposes strict requirements on AI systems, including:

Data Protection: AI must process personal data lawfully, with user consent, and minimize data collection (privacy by design).

Explainability (Article 22): Users have the right to contest automated decisions affecting them, requiring AI to provide meaningful explanations.

Bias & Fairness: AI must avoid discriminatory outcomes, aligning with GDPR’s non-discrimination principles.

Accountability: Organizations must document AI decision-making processes and conduct impact assessments for high-risk AI.


B) Non-maleficence → Ensuring AI does not harm individuals or society.

C) Autonomy → Respecting users’ right to control their data and decisions.

D) Sustainability → Designing AI to be environmentally friendly.

A) Justice → Fair distribution of AI benefits and risks.
